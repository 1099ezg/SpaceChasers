# SpaceChasers
#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FcqSjJJVIo&ab_channel=EthanGabriel
This is a basic 2D pixel game created using the pygame library.

The game includes scoring along with high score tracking, collision detection to check for spaceship touching asteroids, as well as a difficulty timer where spaceship speed increases 25% every 20 seconds. 

The main goal is to last as long as possible while dodging the asteroids to get the highest score.

In the future, I will be adding AI enemies shooting at you while doding asteroids, as well as a shooting function for the player to fire back as well as damage asteroids. Asteroid health will go up as time goees by.
