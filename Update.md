# Update Version 1.1
Date: 9/13/2023

## Updates:
### New Menu Layout
The menu has been completely revamped for a cleaner look. 
I have removed the how to play section and revamped buttons and fonts
### Health Bar
The player will now have 3 lives rather than 1.
A player can strike 3 asteroids before the game will be over
The amount of health you have left will be displayed in the lower left hand corner during the game. 
### Bullets
Bullets have been added into the game, and the player can shoot bullets with the space bar.
The player only has 5 bullets per minute in the game, and will be depicted in the bottom right hand corner in the game.
Every bullet that is shot will be lowered in the counter in the bottom right corner

Bullets are used to shoot asteroids, incase you are unable to move in time. This gives the player a extra chance to survive without losing a heart. 

### Future Update
This update should be released tomorrow and will include:

AI boss that can shoot back at you, you will have to use your bullets to fight the boss. During boss times, bullets are unlimited as you will need to
hit the boss multiple times, and a health bar will be shown above the ai to see how much health it has left. 

Difficulty for AI will increase as the game goes on. 

Second update:
Faster generation, I am aware of a issue where as speeds become extremely fast, asteroids start to spawn less than they should. This will be corrected shortly.
