# Version 1.3 Space Chasers Update

Date: 06/3/2024

## Updates:

#### MySQL Database

I have added a MySQL Database to keep track of your high scores. I have updated the readme on instructions on how to set up the database in vscode since it is not live on the cloud.

#### Score Tracking

Added a new section on the home page that will keep track of all of your high scores from playing. You can exit the game and they will still be saved. It tracks the top 10 high scores and your initials are saved so multiple users can try their best.
