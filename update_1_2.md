# Version 1.2 Space Chasers Update
Date: 10/3/2023

## Updates:

#### Bullet firing mechanics

Mechanics regarding bullet firing has now been fixed. There was a issue with bullets not correctly removing asteroids upon impact.
There was also a bug with bullets not being able to be used at the very beginning of the game, now being fixed

#### Difficulty and Generation bug

There was previously a bug regarding how generation would be effected when higher difficulty levels occured, leading to a easier experience rather
than a harder experience. This was corrected and should be much more difficult with more asteroids being generated at higher levels.
